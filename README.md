## Welcome to dependency hell.

This is amalgamation of different configs I've found around the internet and [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) mixed with personal tastes. If you like watch you see feel free to copy something.

Most of the packages can be installed with pacman. A couple can be found in the AUR. If you can't a specific one on both or your confused on where to find it, do a quick google search, or put in an issue and I'll _try_ to guide you on how to install/use it.

## Notes worth mentioning before reading on.

- I run an AMD cpu, Nvidia GPU machine. Hyprland is known to be weird with nvidia. Some of my configuration tries to fix some issues in reference to hyprland+nvidia. If you're going to copy anything here, _your mileage may vary_.

- I manage my .dotfiles using a git bare repository + submodules for stuff that's shared across my machines.

- I'll be updating this often as there is still much left to customize, so give it a star if you ever wanna comeback and see where it's at!

- You can most definetly take some of the config files found here and use them in another OS _(with some modification of course)_. Stuff like my zsh config fits under this category. Experiment!
